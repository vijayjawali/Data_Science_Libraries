    "In supervised learning, the machine is taught by example. The operator provides the machine learning algorithm with a known dataset that includes desired inputs and outputs, and the algorithm must find a method to determine how to arrive at those inputs and outputs. While the operator knows the correct answers to the problem, the algorithm identifies patterns in data, learns from observations and makes predictions. The algorithm makes predictions and is corrected by the operator – and this process continues until the algorithm achieves a high level of accuracy/performance.\n",

Regression analysis focuses on one dependent variable and a series of other changing variables – making it particularly useful for prediction and forecasting.\n",

The algorithm tries to organise that data in some way to describe its structure. This might mean grouping the data into clusters or arranging it in a way that looks more organised.\n",

Reinforcement learning teaches the machine trial and error. It learns from past experiences and begins to adapt its approach in response to the situation to achieve the best possible result."

    "The K Means Clustering algorithm is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used to categorise unlabelled data, i.e. data without defined categories or groups. The algorithm works by finding groups within the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K. It then works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features provided.</li>\n",

    "Support Vector Machine algorithms are supervised learning models that analyse data used for classification and regression analysis. They essentially filter data into categories, which is achieved by providing a set of training examples, each set marked as belonging to one or the other of the two categories. The algorithm then works to build a model that assigns new values to one category or the other.</li>\n",

    "<li>  Logistic Regression (Supervised learning – Classification)\n",
    "Logistic regression focuses on estimating the probability of an event occurring based on the previous data provided. It is used to cover a binary dependent variable, that is where only two values, 0 and 1, represent outcomes.</li>\n",

    "<li>  Artificial Neural Networks (Reinforcement Learning)\n",
    "An artificial neural network (ANN) comprises ‘units’ arranged in a series of layers, each of which connects to layers on either side. ANNs are inspired by biological systems, such as the brain, and how they process information. ANNs are essentially a large number of interconnected processing elements, working in unison to solve specific problems.\n",

    "Random forests or ‘random decision forests’ is an ensemble learning method, combining multiple algorithms to generate better results for classification, regression and other tasks. Each individual classifier is weak, but when combined with others, can produce excellent results. The algorithm starts with a ‘decision tree’ (a tree-like graph or model of decisions) and an input is entered at the top. It then travels down the tree, with data being segmented into smaller and smaller sets, based on specific variables.</li>\n",

    "##### The Data\n",
    "Knowing your data is the first and foremost step of deciding on an algorithm. Before you start thinking about the different algorithms, you need to familiarize yourself with your data. A simple way to do that is to visualize the data and try to find patterns within it, try to observe it’s behavior, and, most importantly of all, its size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the critical information about your data will help you make an initial decision on an algorithm.\n",
    "1. The size of data: Some algorithms perform better with larger data than others. For example, for small training datasets, algorithms with high bais/ low variance classifiers will work better than low bias/ high variance classifiers. So, for small training data, Naïve Bayes will perform better than kNN.\n",
    "2. The characteristics of data: This means how your data is formed. Is your data linear? Then maybe a linear model will fit it best, such as regressions — linear and logistic — or SVM (support vector machine). However, if your data is more complex, then you need an algorithm like random forest.\n",
    "3. The behavior of data: Are your features sequential or chained? If it is sequential? Are you trying to forecast the weather or the stock market? Then it would be best if you used an algorithm that matches that, such as Markov models and decision trees.\n",
    "4. The type of data: You can either categorize your input or output data. If your input data is labeled, then use a supervised learning algorithm; if not, it’s probably an unsupervised learning problem. On the other hand, if your output data is numeric, then use regression, but if it’s a set of groups, then it’s a clustering problem."

    "Sometimes getting an accurate answer is not necessary for our target application. If an approximation is good enough, we can cut our training and processing time significantly by choosing an approximate model. Approximate methods avoid or don’t perform overfitting or the data, such as linear regression on not-so-linear data."

    "Algorithms like Naïve Bayes and Linear and Logistic regression are easy to understand and implement and, hence they have fast execution. More complex algorithms like SVM, Neural networks, and random forests, need a much longer time to process and train data.\n",
